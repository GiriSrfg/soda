SODA : SODA Open Data Autonomy

## Mission
 - to foster an ecosystem of open source data management and storage software for data autonomy
 - to offer a neutral forum for cross-projects collaboration and integration
  - to provide end users quality end-to-end solutions

## SODA 

SODA Project is the umbrella data framework integration of multiple projects to provide the overall framework solution for the users. All the soda foundation releases go from this project. It comprises of the corresponding projects or repositories of SODA Landscape. 

Each of the SODA Release will be provided a combined solution and use case value integrating selected SODA Projects. It will provide a reference solution/architecture and helps to get a combined value of SODA Landscape projects. This also can help the user to build specific business solution starting from these reference solutions.

All the SODA Releases will be made from github.com/sodafoundation/soda. As per the current plan, we will be starting our quarterly releases from Elba release.
